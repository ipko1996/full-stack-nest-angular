### In case of using mongoDB with Docker or desktop

- I had problems doing this, so I had to use the mongoDB Atlas service.
- Could have used mongoose ofc, but I wanted to try Prisma with MongoDB.
- It has something to do with [MongoDB Replica Issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/8266) (wasted hours with this trying to create a single docker-compose ðŸ¥²)


## Running the app
